# Algorithm

The repository provides my solutions of Algorithm, [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1?) & [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2?), which holds by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick at Princeton University, on Coursera.
Any description of the project in this repository is stated on the lecture website.

## Score
All the assignments must refer to the library [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/), poor score may be achieved unless the assignment follows the specifications and guide.
